# BoM-hoi4-mod-WIP
Currently work in progress

Checklist (need to do)
   
* Land doctrines increase flexibility (meaning its not locked between 1 doctrine that fits only certain stats of units)
* Modify Civilan industry (adding state buildings that produce steel similar to Road To 56)
* Modify Infantry equipment (adding seperate things such as machine guns, mortars, and etc as a seperate production line)
* increase state factory limits 
* rework italy national focus tree
* rework minor's focus tree
* rework most major's focus tree that can start with Historial route or alt route to be oddly compactiable for casual hoi4 gamers
* Railwork balancing stuff (maybe, perhaps lowering the cost to supply hubs)
* Add national spirits to certain majors (limiting early military build up for the USA is an example)
