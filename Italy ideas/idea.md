# Make early military weak 
* Unreliable Infantry equipment (-40%)
* Artillery ( -40% reliablity, -10% soft attack, 5% increase production cost)
* Airforce (-20% reliabilty, -10% in all combat related stats)
* Tanks (-40% reliabilty, -10% hard and soft attack)
* Navy (gets more dockyard output, mix of nerfs and buffs. Kinda weird, like lack of fleet coordnations, but stronger ships [decently modern, like the british counter parts])
* Inflexiable High Command (Using outdated tactics, recommending less high command income, reduction of army XP, entrenchment speed increase, more entrechment bonus, mountain warfare)

# Italy ecnomany is agriculture economy
* make factory output less
