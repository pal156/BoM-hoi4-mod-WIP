# Make early military weak 
* Unreliable Infantry equipment (-20%)
* Artillery ( -20% reliablity, -10% soft attack, 5% increase production cost)
* Airforce (-10% reliabilty, -10% in all combat related stats)
* Tanks (-30% reliabilty, -10% hard and soft attack)
* Navy (gets more dockyard output, mix of nerfs and buffs. Kinda weird, like lack of fleet coordnations, but stronger ships [decently modern, like the british counter parts])
* Inflexiable High Command (Using outdated tactics, recommending less high command income, reduction of army XP, entrenchment speed increase, more entrechment bonus, mountain warfare)

# Italy ecnomany is agriculture economy
* make factory output less (during the early years)
* maybe make Italy's weapon slightly more expensive (maybe)
* more monthly population
* multiple focuses to industrialized (similar to russia's five year plan)
* The industrial focus should be strong but also limited because balance reasons
* Remove debuff on italy's ecnomany should be around 1941

# Reasons why I am doing this
* to somewhat represent italy's advancement into the second world war
* also to force the player to either finish military first or economy first

# buffs for italy thru focus (economy wise)
 * Have a couple focus early that gives free civ factories (maybe 5 at the max or 4)
 * oil in africa and rubber (a decent amount but not the to degree that germany could run off of)
 * construction 20% speed buff
 * slowly increase factory output to a positive 10% buff (this can be like a national spirit or events. It should take a year)
